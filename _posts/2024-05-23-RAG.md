<br><b>ChatGPT.</b> 

We've probably all used it once. Maybe to find recipes, answer questions, or to write our essays for us. ChatGPT is an example of a Large Language model (LLM). These LLMs are trained on a massive amount of text and are able to simulate human conversation and answer specific questions. But of course, sometimes these LLMs can't answer everything. For example, what if we wanted to ask ChatGPT a question about current item stock levels for a store? Since that information wasn't a part of it's training data, theres no way for it to answer. More often than not, we'll often encounter situations where ChatGPT isn't able to answer our question or will even make up and hallucinate an answer!

But fear not! There's still a way we can use LLM's to help us answer specific questions it doesn't know. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

<b>What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?</b>
Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, is a technique which combines LLMs with external knowledge to help it answer questions it doesn't know. At the higher level, it basically involves two key steps, retrieving relevant information from a source, such as a database, based on a users query, and then feeding that information, along with the original query, to an LLM to generate an output.

Now you're probably wondering how exactly the relevant information retrieved based on the users input. To do this, we u

The “Hello world” program is usually the first introduction to any programming language. It looks like this in the C programming language:

```c
/* hello.c */
#import <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  printf("Hello, world!");
  return 0;
}
```

It demonstrates the minimum amount you need to write a C program. In more modern languages however, this example isn’t as useful anymore. Here’s the same example in Python:

```python
# hello.py
print "Hello, world!"
```

## A better hello world

In today’s world of more succint programming languages, we need a different “hello world” to demonstrate language features better. Here’s what I propose:

```
// hello.js
function getGreeting (name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

const message = getGreeting('world')
console.log(message)
```

This simple example demonstrates a few more things than printing strings:

- How to write a function with an argument
- Returning values from functions
- How to use variables
- The naming convention for functions (camelCase versus snake_case)
- String concatenation
- Comments
