The brain is amazingly complex. It's made up of more than 86 billion nerve cells and it's what makes us, well.. us! But when problems occur in the brain and how it functions, debilitating conditions which can take away our ability to do simple things arise. One of these conditions is known as Alzheimer's Disease.

Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by memory
impairment and cognitive decline. It is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases,
typically affecting people over the age of 65. Unfortunately, there's 
no current cure for AD, leaving treatment processes to revolve around delaying the onset of symptoms. So, it's pretty important to detect the presence of the AD as soon possible to ensure early treatment. But this is hard. The underlying factors which cause the disease are complex and still not very well understood. So brings up the question, is there a way we can effectively detect the presence of AD in individuals when we don't fully know the defining patterns or features to look for in brains related to AD? The answer:

<b>Convolutional Neural Networks!</b>

In this project, we present a <b>M</b>ultimodal <b>N</b>euroimaging <b>A</b>ttention-based CNN, <i>MNA-net</i>. Instead of simply classifying whether someone has AD, we focus on predicting the progression of AD, that is, predict whether a cognitively normal individual will develop AD or some form on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the future. To learn the complex features relating to MCI and AD, MNA-net combines both Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET).
