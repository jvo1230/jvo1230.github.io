The brain is amazingly complex. It's made up of more than 86 billion nerve cells and it's what makes us, well, us! But when problems occur in the brain and how it functions, debilitating conditions which can take away our ability to do simple things arise. One of these conditions is known as Alzheimer's Disease.

Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by memory
impairment and cognitive decline. It is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases,
typically affecting people over the age of 65. Unfortunately, there's 
no current cure for AD, leaving treatment processes to revolve around delaying the onset of symptoms. So, it's pretty important to detect the presence of the disease as soon possible. But this is hard. The underlying factors which cause the disease is complex and still not very well understood. So, is there a way that we can effectively detect AD in individuals given the complexity of the disease? The answer:

<b>Convolutional Neural Networks!</b>

In this project, we present a multimodal attention based CNN, MNA-net.
